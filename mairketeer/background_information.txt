Stockton Walbeck, who helped his brother build a $20,000,000 business called Full Time Filmmaker and ran all of the company's advertising. In the process, he discovered that managing the various software subscriptions required to run the business was overwhelming and expensive
    with a total cost of over $5,000 per month. In response, he created Course Creator 360, an all-in-one platform that replaces multiple software subscriptions and simplifies the process of building and launching an online course. The platform is targeted towards course creators who are looking to build, launch, and scale their courses, and is designed to help them generate leads, follow up with those leads, and turn them into buyers. The solution was created through trial and error over a period of five years, during which time Stockton spent over $500,000 on software subscriptions and learned what course creators needed to be successful.
